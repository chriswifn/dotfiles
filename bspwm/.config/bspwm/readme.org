#+title: bspwm configuration
#+author: Christian Hageloch

My configuration for the binary space partitioning window manager (bspwm)

* Features

** Run or raise
A very simple run or raise implementation that is not window manager agnostic and doesn't work well with
programs that rely on daemon processes 

** Dynamic desktops
(see =bspwm_dynamic_desktops=).
The implementation is a 1:1 copy of [[https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles/-/blob/master/bspwm/bin/bspwm_dynamic_desktops][Protesilaos Stavrou]].

* Installation
Dependencies:
- bspwm
- sxhkd
- xprop, xrandr, ... (a working X environment basically)

To install this configuration:
#+begin_src sh
git clone https://gitub.com/chriswifn/bspwm-config.git ~/.config/bspwm
#+end_src
